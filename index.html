                       A "representative" sample looks different for different questions. Is rurality more important or political identity? Maybe you don't even know yet? Leverage the targeting power of digital advertising to recruit a custom pool of respondents, stratified by any variable for which you can gather data.

                       Survey respondents via simple web surveys, chatbots, or any digital experience you can connect. Virtual Lab comes with a lightweight web survey optimized for poor connections and low-powered devices and a chatbot that works with Facebook Messenger. Chat allows you to seemlessly send follow up questions after hours, days, weeks or months for seamless longitudinal studies or experience sampling.

                   Virtual Lab was built to power studies by the World Bank's Development and Impact Evaluation (DIME) unit. Here's how it's been used, both by the Bank and by external research teams:

                   <h2>Gender Attitudes in India</h2>
                   <p>Do short videoclips delivered through social media change gender attitudes and promote information-seeking behaviors in Urban India? </p>


                   <p>
                     This study evaluates a series of online videos supported and produced by two edutainment champions in the field: Population Foundation of India (PFI) and the WEvolve initiative. Respondents are randomly assigned to either a control group or one of three treatment arms, where they are sent videos from PFI, WEvolve, or both.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     Respondents are sent videos, one-at-a-time, over the course of several days. All video plays are recorded on the Virtual Lab platform. Baseline questions on knowledge and attitudes are asked before the videos, one week after the videos are shown, and again after 3 months.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     Respondents are invited to share the videos with their friends as well as sent links to webpages of NGOs working on gender-related topics. Clicks to the websites are tracked and a measurement of time visited calculated allowing the researchers to measure quasi-behavioral outcomes.

                   <p>In addition to its impacts on public health and the global economic system, the novel coronavirus has led to increasing concerns about racial attitudes and stereotypes and their impacts on political attitudes and sentiments towards global cooperation. These stereotypes may also translate into more general geo-political attitudes towards individual countries, such as China, who was at the center of the outbreak. </p>

                   <p>Using the geographical targeting in Facebook's ad platform, respondents were collected across 542 municipalities and 90 provinces in Italy. Surveys began in February, 2020 and were continued through out the crisis, with a few questions being asked to each respondent at weekly or bi-weekly intervals. </p>

                   <p> Asking questions via Messenger enabled the researchers to have continued, constant contact with demographically targeted respondents with low attrition rates and extremely low recruitment costs. </p>

                   <p>What do urban young people in Nigeria want for their future and how do they think about opportunities in the public and private sectors?</p>

                   <p> Recruitment was carried out via an advertising campaign on Facebook targeted to residents of the 10 largest cities in Nigeria, with population above 1 million people (Abuja, Lagos, Kano, Ibadan, Benin City, Port-Harcourt, Jos, Ilorin, Kaduna, Enugu) aged between 13 and 19. To incentivize participation in the survey, the Ad banner displayed a picture of a brand-new Nigerian-made tablet (TECNO DROID PAD 8 II) and a sign saying that anyone who completed our survey would enter a raffle to win up to 3 tablets. </p>

                   <p> Overall, during one week, about 3000 people clicked on the Facebook Ad, about 890 people started the survey and almost 560 completed it. The survey collected information on 1. Beliefs about Public and Private Sectors; 2. Career choices; 3. Use of media. </p>
